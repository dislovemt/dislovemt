## GPT_Vuln-Analyzer Project Contribution Guidelines

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for your interest in contributing to the GPT_Vuln-Analyzer project! We greatly appreciate your help in making our vulnerability analysis tool even better. Below are some guidelines to start your journey as a contributor. 

### Testing and Reporting Errors
- One of the most valuable ways you can contribute is by testing the code thoroughly. 
- Identify any bugs, errors, or unexpected behaviour you encounter during your testing.
- When reporting an issue, please provide clear and detailed steps to reproduce the problem.
- Include any error messages, relevant log outputs, or screenshots that can help us understand and fix the issue.

### Proposing Improvements
- We encourage you to suggest improvements that can enhance the functionality, performance, or usability of the GPT_Vuln-Analyzer project.
- When proposing an improvement, please clearly explain the significance or importance of the suggested change.
- Focus on the "why" rather than the "what." Could you explain how the improvement will benefit users and make the project better as a whole?
- Feel free to share your ideas informally, as if you were explaining them to a friend.

### Keeping the Existing Codebase Intact
- As you contribute, please ensure that your changes do not break any existing functionality.
- Avoid introducing new issues or regressions into the codebase.
- Before submitting a pull request, double-check that your changes do not conflict with or duplicate any existing code.
- If you need guidance or have questions about the existing code, don't hesitate to reach out for clarification.
